# Justin-s-Portfolio

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- I needed a way to represent myself as well as my coding skills to others.

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- I finally have the skillset and confidence to at least try to represent myself well and hopefully to make a good first impression.

- What problem does it solve?
- When applying for a job I need a portfolio to showcase my skills from the projects I have completed.

- What did you learn?
- I learned that I got lucky with my first assignment and that there is a lot more going on in the background than I thought especially when it comes to adjusting everything for proper viewport.
